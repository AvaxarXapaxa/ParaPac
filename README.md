# ParaPac
 Team game submission to the [Pygame Community Summer Team Jam](https://itch.io/jam/pygame-community-summer-team-jam).

## Game Concept
 The [Pygame Community Summer Team Jam](https://itch.io/jam/pygame-community-summer-team-jam) has its theme as **"Remake an  old game with a twist"** which in this case we picked Pacman to be _twisted_. The twist here is that there are enemy pacs and turret pacs, but the real game changer here is the ability to shift your dimension to a secondary map which you can switch from one to the other and retain changes in position. You can use that mechanic to avoid or fight enemies, and to find a way out.
