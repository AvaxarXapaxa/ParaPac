# ParaPac

 Team game submission to the [Pygame Community Summer Team Jam](https://itch.io/jam/pygame-community-summer-team-jam).

## Game Concept

 The [Pygame Community Summer Team Jam](https://itch.io/jam/pygame-community-summer-team-jam) has its theme as **"Remake an  old game with a twist"** which in this case we picked Pacman to be _twisted_. The twist here is the ability to shift your dimension to an alternate map which you can switch from one to the other and retain changes in position. You can use that mechanic to run from enemies or get into places you couldn't go from your position in that dimension alone.
